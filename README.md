Basic Super User
=======

Basic Super User is an Android app to prepare RFO BASIC! flavors, such as OliBasic or hbasic, to compile with the [Android Basic Compiler](https://github.com/mougino/Basic-compiler).
Basic Super User is written in RFO BASIC! with the GW lib and can be installed on all Android devices from Android 2.1 Eclair up to Android 10.

Basic Super User source code is released under the GNU GPL v3 licence as per the attached file "gpl.txt". The licence can be found at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt

## Installing
Compile the project into an APK, copy it to your Android device and click on it to install it. You need to allow for third party installation on your device: see https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-install-apks-31494/

## Dependencies
[RFO BASIC!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rfo.Basic) itself is needed in order to write, run and test your programs. The [Basic Compiler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rfo.compiler) is needed to use the prepared flavors for compilation.


## Building
Basic Super User can be compiled with any Android compiler, from the Android Command-Line tools to Android Studio, but we strongly recommend using the very simple [Android Xp Tools](http://mougino.free.fr/rfo-basic) from the same author.
